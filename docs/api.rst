Symbols, alphabets, words and languages
---------------------------------------

This library main focus are *formal languages*, with particular attention to
*parsing* aspects.

It is hence important first of all to focus  on how **symbols** are represented;
to keep things simple (and make the library more interoperable with the rest of
Python data structures), il LibLet there isn't a specific *type* for such
entities that are always represented by :obj:`strings <str>` (possibly longer
that one character). Observe in passing that Python hasn't a type for
*characters*, but uses strings of length one to represent them.

It is straightforward then to conclude that **alphabets** are represented by
:obj:`sets <set>` of strings.

On the other hand, one must pay particular attention to **words** that are
represented as *sequences* of strings, most commonly :obj:`tuples <tuple>` or
:obj:`lists <list>`. It will never be the case that a LibLet *word* coincides
with a Python *string*! In the very particular case in which all the symbols
have length one (as Python strings) one can use the shortcuts ``list(s)`` and
``''.join(w)`` to go from string to words, and vice versa.

Finally, **languages** are represented by :obj:`sets <set>` of sequences of
strings.


Productions, Grammars and Derivations
-------------------------------------

.. currentmodule:: liblet.grammar

The basic building block of a *grammar* is a *production* represented by the following class.

.. autoclass:: Production

   A convenience method is provided to obtain productions from a suitable string
   representation of them.

   .. automethod:: from_string

   In order to find productions satisfying a set of properties, a convenience method
   to build a predicate from a set of keyword arguments is provided.

   .. automethod:: such_that

For the purpose of presenting the `Knuth Automaton <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser#Finite_state_machine>`__
in the context of LR(0) parsing,  productions are extended to include a dot in the following class.

.. autoclass:: Item

A grammar can be represented by the following class, that can be instantiated
given the usual formal definition of a grammar as a tuple.

.. autoclass:: Grammar

   Even in the case of grammars, a convenience method is provided to build a
   grammar from a suitable string representation. Once the productions are obtained
   with :func:`Production.from_string`, the remaining parameters are
   conventionally inferred as detailed below.

   .. automethod:: from_string

   An utility method is provided to enumerate alternatives for a given left-hand side:

   .. automethod:: alternatives

   To implement grammar "cleanup strategies" a method to eliminate unwanted symbols (and productions)
   from a grammar is also provided.

   .. automethod:: restrict_to

Once a grammar has been defined, one can build derivations with the help of the
following class.

.. autoclass:: Derivation

   .. automethod:: step

   .. automethod:: leftmost

   .. automethod:: rightmost

   .. automethod:: possible_steps

   .. automethod:: steps

   .. automethod:: sentential_form

Derivations can be displayed using a :obj:`~liblet.display.ProductionGraph`.

Transitions and Automata
------------------------

.. currentmodule:: liblet.automaton

Albeit in the context of parsing (that is the main focus of this library), the
role of *finite state automata* and *regular grammars* is not the main focus, a
couple of classes to handle them is provided.

First of all, a basic implementation of a *transition* is provided; as in the
case of grammars, the symbols and terminals are simply :obj:`strings <str>`.

.. autoclass:: Transition

   A convenience method is provided to obtain transitions from a suitable string
   representation of them.

   .. automethod:: from_string


From transitions one can obtain a representation of a (*nondeterministic*)
*finite state automata* using the following class.

.. autoclass:: Automaton

   Even for the automata there are a couple of convenience methods to obtain
   automata from a string representation of the transitions, or from a *regular
   grammar*.

   .. automethod:: from_string

   .. automethod:: from_grammar

    An utility method is provided to represent the *transition function* of the automata.

   .. automethod:: Î´

Automata can be displayed using :obj:`StateTransitionGraph.from_automaton <liblet.display.StateTransitionGraph.from_automaton>`.

ANTLR support
-------------

This library provides a commodity class to deal with `ANTLR <https://www.antlr.org/>`_ for the Python 3 *target*.

.. currentmodule:: liblet.antlr

.. autoclass:: ANTLR

   .. automethod:: print_grammar
   .. automethod:: context
   .. automethod:: tokens
   .. automethod:: tree

.. autoclass:: AnnotatedTreeWalker

   .. automethod:: catchall
   .. automethod:: register
   .. automethod:: RECOURSE_CHILDREN
   .. automethod:: TREE_CATCHALL
   .. automethod:: TEXT_CATCHALL

.. autoclass:: Graph

   .. automethod:: from_adjdict

.. autoclass:: Tree

   .. automethod:: from_lol
   .. automethod:: with_threads
